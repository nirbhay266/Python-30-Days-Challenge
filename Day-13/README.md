# 📚 Stack and Queue Implementation in Python

This repository is part of the **#30DaysOfPython** challenge by [Indian Data Club](https://indiandataclub.com).  
On **Day 13**, I explored and implemented two fundamental data structures:

- 🔷 **Stack** (LIFO – Last In, First Out)
- 🔶 **Queue** (FIFO – First In, First Out)

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Stack
A stack is a linear data structure where the last element added is the first one to be removed.  
Use cases:  
- Undo operations
- Backtracking algorithms
- Expression evaluation
- Function call stack

**Operations:**
- `push()` – Add element to the top
- `pop()` – Remove the top element
- `peek()` – View the top element
- `is_empty()` – Check if stack is empty
- `size()` – Get current size

---

### 🔸 Queue
A queue is a linear data structure where the first element added is the first one to be removed.  
Use cases:  
- Job/task scheduling
- Order processing systems
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)

**Operations:**
- `enqueue()` – Add element to the end
- `dequeue()` – Remove element from the front
- `peek()` – View the front element
- `is_empty()` – Check if queue is empty
- `size()` – Get current size

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the programs:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stack-queue-python.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd stack-queue-python

# Run any file using Python
python stack_class.py


 Learnings & Reflections
Understanding these basic structures is crucial before diving into more complex topics like Trees, Graphs, and Algorithms.
This hands-on challenge helped me:

Write cleaner, modular code using classes

Think in terms of real-world use cases

Build a strong foundation for problem-solving

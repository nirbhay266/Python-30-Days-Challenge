# 🐍 Day 05 – Functions in Python

Welcome to Day 5 of the **30 Days of Python Challenge**, organized by [Indian Data Club](https://indiandataclub.com).  
Today's focus was on one of the most essential concepts in Python programming — **Functions**.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### ✅ Defining Functions
Understanding how to define a function using the `def` keyword and calling it with or without parameters.

### ✅ Function Parameters
Explored different types of parameters:
- **Positional Arguments** – passed in the order they are defined.
- **Keyword Arguments** – passed using `key=value` format.
- **Default Arguments** – provide default values to parameters.

### ✅ Return Statements
Using `return` to send back results from a function, enabling reuse and better flow control.

### ✅ Lambda Functions
Anonymous, one-liner functions defined using the `lambda` keyword — great for quick and simple operations.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Functions help in writing **modular, reusable, and clean code**.
- Using parameters allows functions to handle different kinds of data flexibly.
- Return values make functions more powerful and chainable.
- Lambda functions offer a concise way to write simple logic without formal function definitions.
- Writing functions improved my **problem-solving approach** — I’ve learned how to break down big problems into smaller chunks.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Before this, I used to just write code to "make it work."  
Now, I'm starting to **think like a developer** — solving problems **step-by-step**, and writing functions that are **logical**, **reusable**, and **clean**.

This challenge is helping me build a solid foundation and real programming intuition.
